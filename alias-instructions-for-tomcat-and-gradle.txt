From Loi:
these are the aliases i have for tomcat. 
so, tstart will remove cache directory, and start up tomcat with debugger enable.
   
     alias trestart=‘tstop;tstart’
     alias tstart=‘rm -r ${CATALINA_HOME}/temp/ehcache/*;${CATALINA_HOME}/bin/catalina.sh jpda start’
     alias tstatus=‘ps -ef | grep org.apache.catalina’
     alias tstop=‘${CATALINA_HOME}/bin/catalina.sh stop 1 -force’

I also alias gradle: 
     
     alias grr='gradle --daemon'

When it comes to typing, shorter is always better.
My usual build firefly command would be:  
     
     grr :fi:bAD; trestart

This build, deploy, then restart tomcat after clearing caches to ensure a clean deployment.

Alias is like shortcut in unix.  so, instead of typing gradle --daemon every time, i type grr.

If you’re using bash shell, you can add those lines into your ~/.bashrc file.
Then, you can use the alias as if they are ordinary commands.
